# üõ†Ô∏è Challenge API Update: Add `challengeSource` Field

## üìò Overview

This project enhances the existing Challenge API by adding a new optional field `challengeSource` to indicate the origin of a challenge (e.g., Work Manager, Topgear, GitHub, etc.).

The objective is to:
- Add a new `challengeSource` field (type: `String`) to the Challenge model.
- Ensure this field is supported across Create, Update, Search, and Delete operations in the Challenge API.
- Update the Prisma schema accordingly.
- Maintain compatibility with the current code structure and style.
- Ensure all existing tests pass.

## üóÉÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)
- Express.js
- Swagger (OpenAPI v3)

---

## ‚ú® Features Added

- ‚úÖ New optional field `challengeSource` added to the Challenge model.
- ‚úÖ Field is available in:
  - POST `/challenges`
  - PUT `/challenges/:id`
  - GET `/challenges/:id`
  - GET `/challenges` (supports filtering by `challengeSource`)
  - DELETE `/challenges/:id`
- ‚úÖ Field is stored and retrieved using **PostgreSQL + Prisma**, with all DAL/gRPC/ElasticSearch dependencies removed as per project goals.
